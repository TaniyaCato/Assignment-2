        I started getting interested into heath and fitness about a year ago.
        I had a lot of low self confidence and wasn't enjoying the way I
        looked and felt. One day I decided to change and I've been intrested
        every since. I try to eat healthy every day, and I have also made
        working out apart of my everyday routine. I'm also in a healthy
        relationship, and I have healthey friendships. So not only am I
        phsyically healthy but mentally as well.

      <h3>Nutrition</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to being healthy and fit, it isn't all about just
        working out, you also have to eat better for faster results. You need
        quality foods, protein, heart-healthy fats, and fluids. Your muscles
        rely on carbohydrate foods such as: breads, pastas, fruits, and
        vegetables. The only types of foods that you need to focus on before
        working out are foods that are: low fat, low fiber, and contain
        fluids. It is very important to drink plenty of water, water acts as
        your body's cooling system. Staying dehydrated is very important,
        especially when working out. Sport drinks are also very helpful, they
        give you enough carbs and sodiums, as well as fluids.
