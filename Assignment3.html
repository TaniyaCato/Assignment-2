            I started getting interested into heath and fitness about a year ago.
            I had a lot of low self confidence and wasn't enjoying the way I
            looked and felt. One day I decided to change and I've been intrested
            every since. I try to eat healthy every day, and I have also made
            working out apart of my everyday routine. I'm also in a healthy
            relationship, and I have healthey friendships. So not only am I
            phsyically healthy but mentally as well.

          <h3>Workouts to Improve Fitness Levels</h3>
          <p>
            -Endurance Training, helps develop stamina, and improve the
            functioning of the heart and lungs, it also helps people who are
            looking to losing weight, burn calories.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            -Strength Training, known as resistance training. The resistance can
            come from using barbells, dumbbells, resistance bands, or strength
            machines. So this would be more for people who are trying to tone
            there body or gain weight.
          </p>
    
          <p>

            static stretching include enhanced range of motion, stronger joints,
            and better physical performance if you play sports. So this is meant
            more for athletes.

          <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                When it comes to being healthy and fit, it isn't all about just
                working out, you also have to eat better for faster results. You need
                quality foods, protein, heart-healthy fats, and fluids. Your muscles
                rely on carbohydrate foods such as: breads, pastas, fruits, and
                vegetables. The only types of foods that you need to focus on before
                working out are foods that are: low fat, low fiber, and contain
                fluids. It is very important to drink plenty of water, water acts as
                your body's cooling system. Staying dehydrated is very important,
                especially when working out. Sport drinks are also very helpful, they
                give you enough carbs and sodiums, as well as fluids.
